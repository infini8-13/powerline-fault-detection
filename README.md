# Powerline Fault Detection for Partial Discharge using Deep Learning

Today, insulated overhead conductors are increasingly used in
many places of the world due to the higher operational reliability, elimination of
phase-to-phase contact, closer distances between phases and stronger protection for
animals. However, the standard protection devices are often not able to detect the
conductorâ€™s phase-to-ground fault and the more frequent tree/tree branch hitting
conductor events as these events only lead to partial discharge (PD) activities
instead of causing overcurrent seen on bare conductors.
